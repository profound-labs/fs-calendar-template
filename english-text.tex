These days are regularly devoted to quiet reflection at the monastery.\\
The dates for the lunar calendar are determined by traditional methods of calculation\\
and are not always on the same day as the astronomical occurrences.

\renewcommand\SetAllQuotes{%

\SetQuoteText{1}{%
The essence of Buddhism is peace, and that peace arises\\
from truly knowing the nature of all things.
}

\SetQuoteText{2}{%
Once we are free, whatever our situation may be,\\
we won't have to suffer. If we have children, we won't have to suffer.\\
If we work, we won't have to suffer.
}

\SetQuoteText{3}{%
Practising generosity cleanses our hearts of selfishness;\\
our mind grows in compassion and caring towards all living beings.
}

\SetQuoteText{4}{%
There is one essential point that all good practice must eventually come to,\\
and that is not clinging. In the end,\\
all teachings and teachers must be let go of.
}

\SetQuoteText{5}{%
Everything you use in this life is support for the practice.\\
If your dwelling place is an utter mess then your mind will be the same.
}

\SetQuoteText{6}{%
We are taught first to abandon evil and establish that which is good.\\
Then we must transcend good and evil.
}

\SetQuoteText{7}{%
Walking the path, don’t be careless. Even if you are right, don't be careless.\\
If you are wrong, don't be careless.
}

\SetQuoteText{8}{%
This is the way practice should proceed:\\
firstly, we need to be upright and honest; secondly, to be wary of wrongdoing;\\
and thirdly, to have a heart imbued with humility.
}

\SetQuoteText{9}{%
Dhamma practice means upholding virtue, developing samādhi and\\
cultivating wisdom in our hearts. Reflect on the Triple Gem.\\
Strive on with sincerity.
}

\SetQuoteText{10}{%
Whatever virtues have been cultivated are imperfect if lacking in mindfulness.\\
Mindfulness is life. It is a cause for the arising\\
of self-awareness and wisdom.
}

\SetQuoteText{11}{%
Birth, ageing, illness, and death: these are universal truths.\\
See this clearly, acknowledge these facts\\
and you will be able to let go.
}

\SetQuoteText{12}{%
After awakening, the Buddha and his disciples still maintained their practice.\\
Effort was their way, their natural habit. I think we should take\\
their example as a model for our practice.
}
